CS 3013 Project 3
Oliver Thode, Andrei Bornstein

In this project, we implemented the Gompei memory allocator, a user-space memory management tool. The functionality of this tool includes initializing and destroying a memory "arena" as well as allocating and freeing memory chunks within that arena. All of the functions work as expected, and all of the tests pass.
